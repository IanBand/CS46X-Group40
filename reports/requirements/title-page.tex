        \begin{abstract}
          This document outlines the requirements for the Fortran to Python conversion capstone project. It begins by introducing what problem is being solved. It then gives a brief overview of a solution to the problem along with the requirements and verification steps for that solution. It ends with an expected timeline for the development of the solution.
