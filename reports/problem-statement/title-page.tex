            This paper outlines the problem in using legacy simulation software described by Genevieve Segol. As well, it outlines a solution for building a better, more portable, system for generating simulations of hydrologic system behaviors for use in water-resource research. The application will be developed to dynamically execute a numerical model estimating the behavior of groundwater. A modern graphical interface will be designed and developed to enhance both usability and portability of the application. This could facilitate a wider range of use for the model in other applications for hydrology research.
